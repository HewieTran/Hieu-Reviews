Blindspotting,,,,,,,"So many great movies this summer but Blindspotting.. the movie made me hate myself for casting doubts on it. It was a perfect movie for me. so much charm, so much heart, a lot of controversial issues but presented fairly, and hilarious. Can't wait to watch this again.

The trailer marketed this movie as an action thriller, so I thought I knew what to expect. But the movie itself was more like an ""introspective coming of age"" movie."
Annihilation,,,,,,,"The most mesmerizing and traumatizing sci-fi horror I've seen in a fkn while. Reminds me of ""Arrival"" but definitely more horror element. Would love to see more movies like this in da future "
Hereditary,,,,,,,"I think the last time I genuinely felt scared watching a horror movie was me at ~12 when I saw ""the Others"". After years of seeing many great and bad horror movies, I finally felt that same genuine scarred feeling after watching ""Hereditary"" last month.

It's a supernatural horror movie, but the acting chopz from Toni Collette and Alex Wolfe really sucked me in and made me feel absolutely dreaded the whole time in the best way possible."
Paddington 2,,,,,,,"The best family movie of the year and arguably my top 5 movie of 2018. Just pure joy, a lot of heart, warm, and fuzzy just like mistah Paddington. Watching our hero Paddington go through so much shit for his aunt will absolutely melt your heart. This here is definitely the best scene in the movie for me."
A Star Is Born,,,,,A Star Is Born (800x400).png,A Star Is Born (800x400).png,"The first 30 minutes of this movie (when lady Gaga performed shallow for the first time) was perfect yo, 10/10. The rest of the movie after that felt off, the pacing was definitely the problem. It's like drinking a cold one on a hot day in the back seat, and then the car start hitting bumps on the road for the rest of the ride."
Overlord,,,,,,,"Surprisingly as good as you'd expect base on the RT score. A tad bit disappointed with the lack of zombies. Wasn't hoping for World War Z level of zombies, but a lot of scenes in this one didn't really use the zombie element. The budget was prob the problem. But the main villain definitely stole the show, protagonists are easily forgettable tho."
